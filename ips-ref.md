| [Ambient Intelligence](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-88546-7_47) | In computing, ambient intelligence refers to electronic environments that are sensitive and responsive to the presence of people. |
| [IPS Market](https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/5427261/global-indoor-location-market-by-component) | The global indoor location market is projected to grow from USD 8.8 billion in 2022 to USD 24 billion by 2027, at a CAGR of 22.4% during the forecast period. |
| [IPS with R](https://doi.org/10.1109/indin.2017.8104909) | We believe that the R language is a good environment for machine learning and data analysis related research. R is popular with data science and it's packages are constantly growing/ maintained resulting in researchers related to indoor positioning explicitly selecting R as developing framework for their experiments |
| [Probabilistic Approach to IPS](https://doi.org/10.1023/a:1016003126882) | Uses collections of many fingerprints at each particular position, acquired during the training phase. Therefore, the radio map is composed of several groups, where a group is a set of fingerprints (vectors of RSSI values) that share the same received time |
