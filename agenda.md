## Member Agenda:
### braadams:
- [ ] Create R script for tidying any data set. 
- [ ] b.
- [ ] c.

##### Files Currently Editing
- `grid.Rmd`
Agenda/Role
: Develop methodology for tidying any data set to desired data frame.

### cyrus-pdx:
- [x] create base grid
- [x] find distances from AP's to receiver locations
- [ ] plot `rssi` values over the base grid
- [ ] plot `c` values over the base grid
- [ ] create interactive plot to show combined data over the base grid
- [ ] use `c`, `mac_ap`, and `rssi` value to create methodology for IPS.

##### Files Currently Editing
Agenda/Role
: I have created a base grid with colorized coordinate data that can be found in the etc directory. My goal is to plot an interactive overlay of the signal strengths for each `offline` coordinate grouped by the broadcasting access point. To accomplish this I used the Pythagorean theorem to create a new variable called `c` to map `rssi` values to distance to eventually understand accuracy when predicting location. 

### jadiri28:
- [ ] Complete introduction paragraph
- [ ] b.
- [ ] c.
